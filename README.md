# Large Table Experiment

I quickly wanted to evaluate how modifications of a table *in* the DOM with the help of promises impact browser performance.

This test builds on the LoopBack framework on the server side and faker for generating some random data. There is Bootstrap 4 and Backbone.js and jQuery on the client side.

Front-end dependencies loaded via CDN, no fancy hot reload or build chain.
